Made a plan finally for the remainder of phase 1 after the FYP meeting from earlier in the week with the change of direction (kind of)

Got some clarity for what the rest of the project will look like which is detailed in: "../phases_2_to_4_overview.md"

Phase 3 is probably the most critical in terms of systems programming so needs to be started very soon. Phase 1 is key for a good foundation. It is all about syscall exploration.

Also done today:

Understanding toolchaining which has been tough, but finally got some kind of platform agnostic makefile setup. 

Kind of understand now finally that hip_cpu uses inline headers to provide all library functions.
No dynamic library linking!


Make has its own syntax with if statements etc. 


    $(BASELINE_EXE): $(SRC) | $(BUILD_DIR)
        $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $< -o $@ -DBASELINE

    TARGET : NORMAL_DEPS | ORDER_ONLY_DEPS
    <TAB> RECIPE

ORDER_ONLY_DEPS are important and basically its like saying, this must exist for the build to continue but changes inside this directory or in these flags do not require a complete rebuild.

In the recipe, the: "$<" is Make translation for the first dependency i.e the NORMAL_DEPS and the $@ is for the TARGET.

Got the Make command working and the trace.cc program compiling in the three different scenarios. 3 executables in my build/ dir.
