Pretty tool-chain intensive day. Installing HIP-CPU libraries on linux VM.

Sorted out include paths and learned about where global includes are held.

Made cross platform compatible code.

Learned about 2> for compiler error outputs.

Started first use of the -strace to see system call traces for a simple return 0 program.
