Bit of a difficult day- dealing with a lot of brain fog + fatigue after exams but good progress on the first day back.


Wrote 3 variations of a kernel launch and will profile it using the syscall compile flag tomorrow.

Had a lot of trouble getting the include paths to work properly.

I had also forgotten a lot of the GPU programming semantics, especially with things like the device and host pointers and how they are handled together.

Also things like what kernel launches actually are, and how they are managed. Things like hipdeviceSynchronise all that stuff. Most important thing I learned today was:


int* dev_ptr = nullptr;
hipMalloc(&dev_ptr, size_t...);

hipMalloc takes as first arguement: **ptr. 

dev_ptr now is a pointer to a memory location in the device and must not be dereferenced by the cpu but it acts as our placeholder or view into the device memory.

for example: hipMemCpy(dev_ptr, cpu_source_ptr,...);

We are copying something from the host (pointed to by cpu_source_ptr) and that is copied to the address space on the DEVICE pointed to by dev_ptr.
