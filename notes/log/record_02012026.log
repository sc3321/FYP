Completed the baseline program and re-ran the test suite with the new code and regathered all of the data for the plots and statistics.

I also finally got my head around what the research questions are about, and how to systematically go about collecting the data for the remaining experiments and for the hand-off to phase 2. All of that reading and prompting has got me some good understanding thankfully.

I have written a research skeleton to explain my thought-process and it should fit in directly with the report. Should be really easy to use a lot of the information gathered and the report(s) written in my final interim report.

One thing I understood was learning the difference in the metrics of syscall count and syscall time.

syscall count is important in understanding structurally how the OS interacts with a program. It helps give a guide into if the syscall is something which is involved for every unit of work, on startup/completion, book-keeping... We can use syscall count / iteration to give us this idea of how the OS interaction scales with the program for every iteration (which just helps normalise the data and remove noise).

syscall time and syscall time/count is more of a measure of actual cost. It can help us deduce which syscalls are actually costly in the real-life program flow. It is a performance metric of the program and system.
