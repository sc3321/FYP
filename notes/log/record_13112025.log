# OS
    - The fundamental interface between hardware resources and software applications.
    - The term kernel and OS are used interchangeably. The kernel is actually the part (primary) of the OS responsible for hardware interfacing.
    - Operating systems also have system calls (syscalls) which is an interface that the OS provides to user applications to invoke the hardware resources
    - Primary purpose of an OS is to ABSTRACT these hardware resources to software in a consistent, logical manner.

"OS abstractions":
    SysCalls are the surface at which these abstractions are presented to user applications. It is like a contract that software programmers know for that target OS. 
    After these SysCalls are invoked by a piece of software, the CPU will switch from user mode to kernel mode and the kernel part of the OS will take-over and handle the actual hardware responsibilities.

My project is investigating both layers of the stack:
    - Are the existing abstractions good enough for efficient programming for AI workloads?
    - Is there good enough support in the OS to fulfill those needs?
