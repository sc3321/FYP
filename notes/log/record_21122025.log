Made a plan finally for the remainder of phase 1 after the FYP meeting from earlier in the week with the change of direction (kind of)

Got some clarity for what the rest of the project will look like which is detailed in: "../phases_2_to_4_overview.md"

Phase 3 is probably the most critical in terms of systems programming so needs to be started very soon. Phase 1 is key for a good foundation. It is all about syscall exploration.
