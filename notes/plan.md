# Plan
3 axes of the project understanding:
  1- AI workload characteristics.
  2- OS kernel Abstractions.
  3- Data-center context.

# Skills

  - OS internals
  - Linux Kernel Development
  - GPU architecture/workloads
  - Perf analysis.
  - Research methodology.

By Jan 1st:
  - Build and boot a Linux kernel.
  - Write and load simple kernel modules (OS Abstractions)
  - Profile GPU workloads.
  - Have an understanding of where the Abstractions meet the GPU workloads.
